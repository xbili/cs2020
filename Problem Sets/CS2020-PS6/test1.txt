Expository Writing Paper The Falling Man fig 1. is one of a series of photographs taken by Richard Drew during the September 11 terror attacks on World Trade Centre. As a result of the disturbing content and horror that it portrays, it has led to numerous debates on censorship in photojournalism. While some debated that the photograph was disrespectful to the dead, others claim that it documented the terror event aptly. Further research shows that the September 11 photographs in general has psychological and societal impacts in alleviating trauma. In this paper, I argue that the photograph should not be censored due to its contribution to the nation's recovery from public trauma. The photograph depicts a male falling headfirst along the World Trade Centre, with the two towers in the background. "The perfect linearity of the two towers, which meet in the centre of the photograph as if forming the spine of a book, are sliced by the man's torpedolike form." Fitzpatrick 88 Coupled with the different lighting on his clothing, the photograph can be distributed on print media with ease. Fitzpatrick 88 Therefore, The Falling Man stood out from the other photographs of people falling. The controversy began when media decided to label these victims "jumpers". Joanne Faulkner mentioned in her research that "the New York Medical Examiner's Office stated that "jumper" is somebody who goes to the office in the morning knowing that they will commit suicide." 70 The people who jumped out on the day itself did not have the intention to commit suicide, but were forced out of the building in desperation. Another controversy that arise from the photographs was intrusion of privacy. Faulkner argues that it had "betrayed a private moment, what should remain the most private moment of a person's life. 71 This sparked further outrage among communities which deemed the photographs of "jumpers" as too graphic and traumatising. "The images were seen as too gruesome, too unmediated a confrontation with the horror of the moment." Kroes 4 They depicted the death of potential family members and was seen as disrespectful to the dead. These controversies argues for the censorship of the photograph. Within the short duration after September 11, the media should not provoke further public chaos, but try to bring people together. Which explains why photographs depicting heroic acts during recovery were more well received by the public. Reuters has published a full volume, documenting images of "endurance, resolve and determination." Kennedy 276 It helps people to feel a sense of unity, that they can tide through any ordeals no matter how bad things get. Whereas photographs such as The Falling Man made people feel like they were "punched in the stomach, you know it was such a strong image...just the last moment of the person's life." Reinacher 5 Despite the controversies that the photograph has caused, The Falling Man photograph represented a group of people who jumped because they chose to die by jumping rather than burning to death or by asphyixation. By censoring the image, they were swept under the carpet as if they did not exist. 9/11: The Falling Man This is against the media's responsbility to show the public what happened. The role of censorship is "to prevent the pervision of public opinion in its social component...to prevent any conflict with the fundamental principles of the organisation of society." Ribeiro 75 The photograph tells the story of those who jumped and did not compromise with any fundamental principles of America. In fact, it should be in line with the American belief in the freedom of choice. Simply by removing them from existence is a greater injustice than acknowledging the existence of this group of people. Therefore, the photograph should not have been censored so as to honor the death of those who fell. The photograph does not only represent a distinct group of people, it could also bring about positive impacts that this photograph has on society, mainly the alleviation of public trauma. After the September 11 attacks, photographs of the towers appeared repeatedly over time. In Barbie Zelizer's paper on Photograph, Journalism and Trauma, bearing witness is defined as "an act of witnessing that enables people to take responsbility for what they see."52  "Depictions of the towers became key to the act of bearing witness." 58 Similar to the photographos of Nazi concentration camps in World War 2, it "force spectators to fill in what they knew existed but was nowhere within the camera's frame." 53 In the context of the September 11 attacks, we know that people died. However, the process of their death is up to our imagination. The images "helped prolong the act of witnessing" and was "central to the larger aims of moving toward recoery and mobilizing support" 64. In other words, the September 11 photographs played its role in facilitating the post-traumatic recovery of America and the world. The Falling Man photograph in particular would have contributed to a large extent in this process had it not been censored. In Junod's paper, he mentioned that "no one who saw it the fall wished to see it again." 179 This is in line with Zelizer's argument about "bearing witness". Being shown the Falling Man repeatedly "prolongs the act of witnessing." 64 The falling victims "embodied the unfolding of the events themselves, actualizing the disaster with a precise indivudation of human loss and giving flesh and form to the falling movements by which the architecture also was destroyed." Fitzpatrick 88 The Falling Man represents loved ones lost, regardless by falling or other manner of death. Fitzpatrick 88 In addition, the clarity of image revealed fine details about the man, including his clothing and facial features. This "humanazing...shocks the viewer out of an aesthetic response into an emotional one," Fitzpatrick 89 hence amplifying the effect of alleviating trauma by moving the public "from its initial state of disarray and shock toward a post-traumatic state." Zelizer 48 Therefore The Falling Man should have not been censored as a result of the possible positive impacts it could have on society.  After evaluating the reasons for and against the censorship of the photograph, it is evident that censoring Richard Drew's The Falling Man was a mistake by the media. If the image had not been censored, the nation might have moved on into a post-traumatic state quicker than it did. The potential impact it could have on alleviating public trauma outweighs the risk of chaos arising from the publishing of the photograph. Therefore, The Falling Man should have been published freely, rather than tucked away from the public's view. Whereas this paper discusses about the censorship of the photograph, further research questions include if the photograph should even be taken in the first place? The essence of photojournalism is to deliver the true story, but to what extent? With this study, photohistorians in their further research should take into account the possible impacts images have on society rather than just the underlying meaning when it comes to crisis photography such as The Falling Man.
