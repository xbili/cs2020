1d. The answer is: 3125.
	Mystery function finds argA to the power of argB

2c. In order to prevent such errors from happening, we could check if the length of seed is equals to the size which was passed in as argument.
	To test for such an error, we should expect the methods to return an Exception if the size passed in is larger/smaller than the length of seed.
	
2d. The implementation for such a scheme is shown in ShiftRegsiterCrypto.java
	
	Similiar to ImageEncode, we XOR each value of the password with a ShiftRegister that has a seed to both encrypt and decrypt the password.
	
	The picture is a collection of photos of all CS2020 tutors.
	
2e. A shift register has to be shifted 2^n - 1 times in order for output pattern to repeat. This is due to the nature of XOR, which prevents
	all of the bits to be 0. 
	
	Some taps work better for different bit seeds, they reduce the repetition of output pattern.
	
	An implementation of the toBinary is written in TextToBinary.java
	
	It has happened only for a couple of times with certain specific seeds. 
	
3(iii) Judging from the outputs, I would say that 0.41 is a rough estimate of the threshold.
		This means that Cromwell and Vortigern were not written by Shakespeare, 
		while Hamlet, Henry V, Mystery and Macbeth were written by Shakespeare.
