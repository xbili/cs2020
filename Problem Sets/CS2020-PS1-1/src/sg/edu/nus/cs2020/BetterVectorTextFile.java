/**
 * Class: BetterVectorTextFile
 * 
 * Purpose: Represents a text file as a vector, i.e., 
 * as a sorted array of word/count pairs that appear 
 * in the text file.
 * 
 * Inherits from: VectorTextFile
 * 
 * Constructor: BetterVectorTextFile(String fileName)
 * 
 * All the functionality is equivalent to the VectorTextFile,
 * except for reading in a file, which is performed much more
 * efficiently.
 * 
 * Public Class Methods:
 * 		int Norm() : Returns the norm of the vector.
 * 
 * Static Methods:
 * 		double DotProduct(VectorTextFile A, VectorTextFile B) : 
 * 			Returns the dot product of two vectors.
 * 		double Angle(VectorTextFile A, VectorTextFile B) : 
 * 			Returns the angle between two vectors.

	 * Properties: The string returned contains every character in the 
	 * specified file, in the same order, except:
	 * 		(a) Every letter is lower-case.
	 * 		(b) All punctuation is removed.
	 * 		(c) Each end-of-line marker ('\n') is replaced with a space.
	 * 		(d) All (other) non-letters and non-spaces are removed.
	 * 		(e) Words are separated by exactly one space.
	 * 
	 * Unlike the original VectorTextFile ReadFile implementation, this
	 * version runs in O(n) times.
