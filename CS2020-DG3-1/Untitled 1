**Error Checks**

Integer overflows -> Long/BigInteger

* NullPointerExceptions
	null != empty

Copy of arrays:
	**wrong** b = a;
	In this case b is a pointer to a
	a[0] = 5,
	// this case b[0] will also be 5.
	
	b = Arrays.copyOf(a, <length>);
	
Static
	Access member variable/method without instantiating an object
	
	Useful for: 
		Game development: global clock
		
	Only static methods can edit static variables
	
	Static methods call from class e.g. BigInteger.valueOf()
	Class methods call from object e.g. a.pow(1000)
	
	
Interface 
	Methods cannot have body
	Didn't implement the full interface
	 
	 
Multiple Inheritance
	 Try to avoid
	 Diamond of death
	 
**Subclass substitutivity**

Problem 3.
	a. Doesn't call super
		Code still works in most cases, but not in this case.
		super() without any arguments will throw an error, because Drink doesn't have a constructor without any arguments
		
	b. A Coke is a Drink
		**Subclass substitutivity**
		But a Drink is not a Coke
	
	c. Runs fine.
		**The parent can be stricter than the children**
			Access right of parent class can be stricter than children
			You cannot use a private method to override a public method, but can do it the other way round.
			
	d. 
		checkSoda in `super` calls checkSoda of Coke.
		super will still call methods of child class
		static will still call static method of their own class

	Java passes by reference
	
	Analogy: 
	i is address of student, go to i and increase value of m_int
	
	But then myOtherIntAddOne
