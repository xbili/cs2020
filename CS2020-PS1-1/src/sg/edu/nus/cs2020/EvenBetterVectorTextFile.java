/**
 * Class: EvenBetterVectorTextFile
 * 
 * Purpose: Represents a text file as a vector, i.e., 
 * as a sorted array of word/count pairs that appear 
 * in the text file.
 * 
 * Inherits from: BetterVectorTextFile
 * 
 * Constructor: EvenBetterVectorTextFile(String fileName)
 * 
 * All the functionality is equivalent to the BetterVectorTextFile,
 * except for sorting, which is performed more efficiently using
 * MergeSort, instead of InsertionSort.
 *   
 * Public Class Methods:
 * 		int Norm() : Returns the norm of the vector.
 * 
 * Static Methods:
 * 		double DotProduct(VectorTextFile A, VectorTextFile B) : 
 * 			Returns the dot product of two vectors.
 * 		double Angle(VectorTextFile A, VectorTextFile B) : 
 * 			Returns the angle between two vectors.
